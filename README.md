Discord bot using Riot API

Hello! The purpose of this bot is to show the matches that people play with others in the popular MOBA League of Legends. 
When typing in a gamer ID into a discord channel that the bot is live in followed by one of the available commands (ex. !rank),
the results will display all the matches that the player played where they entered the game from the same lobby as another player(s). Feel free
to contact me for more information on the bot :). The information is gathered from the official Riot Games API.

In the future, I definitely will be rewriting this bot to allow for more thorough analysis of each match.
